        <p><em>Software Engineer</em></p>
        <p>I have been commissioned by God to lear Swift, Apple's coding language for apps. I have begun my journey with HTML, CSS and Javascript. After completing Angela Yu's Web Development Course on Udemy, I will use every resource available to me
          in
          order to learn Swift. I plan to begin with Devslopes course on iOS Development and progress from there to searching Udemy for different courses. Angela Yu's course for iOS Development is a purchase possibility for me. Devslopes also has a
          program
          in which they guarantee they will stick with you until you get a job in the field in which they have been teaching you. In the meantime, I will also be using XCode's different playgrounds to familiarize myself with Swift's syntax and
          structure.
