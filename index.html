        <p><em>Aspiring App Developer</em></p>
        <p>I have begun learning to build apps by progressing through Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy. This course has taught me design principles, layout and orientation configuration, along with more advanced programming concepts. I have built 6 apps so far with more on the way. 
          You will find a few of my apps on My Work page. During my college education I took a course on programming fundamentals in which I learned how to manipulate objects such as classes, libraries, arrays and vectors in order to achieve my goal with the program. I have completed other overviews on Web Development as well.
        </p>

        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing basketball with my friends. Reading The Lord of the Rings, or usually listening on Audible. I often will go to my backyard and set up my target to hone my arhcery skills. I'd like to one day go bow hunting. I also dabble in the odd video game every now and then. Destiny was one of my favorites.</p>
